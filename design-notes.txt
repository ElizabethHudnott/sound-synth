URGENT
* copyParameter and swapParameters should work between two columns (or the same column) of a pattern rather than (limited to) within a phrase (+turn into generators)
option to alter LINE_TIME changes inside expand(), compact() and copyAndCompact
* Phrase.transpose needs to transpose phrases not currently transposed
* Handle when a pattern with nested phrases is expanded or compacted: Add a PHRASE_SPEED parameter?

* Let PHRASE_TRANSPOSE work when rows are not aligned
* Change PATTERN_DELAY to LINE_REPEAT (in lines rather than ticks, repeat everything except GATE, LINE_REPEAT and incrementing the phrase offset)
* Review direct access to Change.value in playback routine
* Support nested phrases in the master column
* Allow columns to move at different tempos
(Second kind of loop: column loop?)
	* Columns that exhaust their rows before another column completes start looping
	- Can designate one column to loop x times before moving onto the next pattern (otherwise the pattern ends when the longest column completes once (including normal loop parameters))
	- If the same phrase is on the same channel in two consecutive patterns then have the option to continue playing without restarting ("free running", offset ignored) as a phrase property
Phrase:
	* loop on/off (Reuse LOOPS parameter, any non-zero value)
	* loop start point (Reuse LOOPS parameter)
	- "free running" on/off
* Song playback shouldn't all be scheduled at once
	Actually a whole pattern should be scheduled at once so ChangeType.EXPONENTIAL works

NEXT FEATURES
Method to quantize to every x lines (also reduce delays for x<1, set to 0 otherwise)
	If notes are triggered more than once or twice per quantum then quantize them to the 1/3, 1/2 & 2/3 waypoints or not at all (noteParameters)
	Quantize the durations also
	How to handle pattern/column delay?
Method to quantize relative to another track
Method to randomize/humanize
Add PHRASE_VELOCITY parameter (dynamics)
Song Loop From
Freeze/Unfreeze phrase (render to buffer for better performance)

UNDESIGNED
Area for scratch, unused patterns and/or phrases
Edit function to reverse a sequence of rows
Initial song parameters for Channel 1,... Channel N

MAYBES
Phrase/pattern forwards/backwards (step 1, -1, maybe more) (how to counter messing up fades?)
Changes that alternate/randomize between a fixed range of options on each pass
Probability / Aleatoric / Chance / Indeterminate music

Sequencer UI
------------
ability to drag entire graph up or down, etc.
ability to select multiple graph nodes

Documentation
-------------
Make Wiki complete and up to date

MIDI/Input
----------
New modes:
	unison
	combinations with phrase trigger in lower octaves
Metronome UI

UI
--
Bug: when MAX_WAVEFORM is changed while noise is active (fix during the rewrite)

Sampler
-------
UI:
	allow inserting exact number of samples of silence
	draw clipping
	pencil tool (with cubic interpolation)
	Context menu: undo, redo | cut*, copy*, paste, paste mixed, trim* (to selection) | select all | set as loop (or set as loop start + set as loop end)
		* = not visible when there's no selection
	Pan without shift key, select with shift key
	Page down
	Shift+Ctrl+left/right should snap to zero crossing, loop points, start and end + Snap using mouse mode
	Trim to selection
	Scroll bar not visible on mobile -> Draw a custom one
	playback separately OR on a track
	UI for Parameter.OFFSET? ruler and snap
samples need names
method to create a sample by crossfading one sample into another
trim silence method
Check Number.MAX_VALUE is being applied consistently
editing stereo sample channels separately
Time stretching
Add custom offset/beat slice positions
	(e.g. see https://www.renoise.com/blog/Slice%20Markers%20Explained)
MOD2Sample (advanced)

Synth
-----
Choice of sample release action (fade or end loop)
Reverb
UI Rewrite
Choice of New Note Action
	(release, cut, continue until gate closed or cut, duplicate notes of the same instrument always cut)
Instruments
Velocity & Pitch Automations
	Add "Noise Type 2" to UI
Changes for 1 line vs changes over a pattern vs ongoing results?
Allow choosing sampled notes by time as well as by pitch (for percussion)?

Glide / Arpeggio
-----
Glide amount (a time or a rate)
Glide mode (time or rate)
Handle gate triggered previously but not yet closed

Noise
-----
Noise through filter as a modulation source

Low Priority
------------
Parse smpl and inst chunks of a WAV file.
Parse more than one sample per IFF file + envelope chunks, etc.
Make modals local to the component (Sampler, Synth...) (https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-display-a-bootstrap-modal-inside-a-div/)
Insert silence modal: String should be fixed length, overtype entry, spinners increment current column

------
LFO modulating decay, etc.
LFO rate modulated by an envelope
LFO rate modulated by an LFO
LFO amount modulated by an LFO
**Pulse width modulated by an envelope**
