Sequencer
---------
* copyParameter and swapParameters should work between two columns (or the same column) of a pattern rather than (limited to) within a phrase (+turn into generators)
option to alter LINE_TIME changes inside expand(), compact() and copyAndCompact
Method to quantize to every x lines (also reduce delays for x<1, set to 0 otherwise) How to handle pattern/phrase delay?
	Complementary method to randomize
* Phrase.transpose needs to transpose phrases not currently transposed

* Let PHRASE_TRANSPOSE work when rows are not aligned
* Change PATTERN_DELAY to PHRASE_DELAY
* Allow each column to loop independently (remove pattern length property)
	* Allow columns to move at different tempos
	* Master column to move at the speed of the slowest column
Second kind of loop: column loop
	* Columns that exhaust their rows before another column completes start looping
	- Can designate one column to loop x times before moving onto the next pattern (otherwise the pattern ends when the longest column completes once (including normal loop parameters))
	- If the same phrase is on the same channel in two consecutive patterns then have the option to continue playing without restarting ("free running", offset ignored) as a phrase property
Phrase:
	* loop on/off (when not used as a column)
	* loop start point
	- "free running" on/off

Add PHRASE_VELOCITY parameter
Handle when a pattern with nested phrases is expanded or compacted: Add a PHRASE_SPEED parameter?
Loop start and end position incrementing (how to counter messing up fades?)
Edit function to reverse a sequence of rows
Phrase/pattern forwards/backwards (step 1, -1, maybe more) (how to counter messing up fades?)
Song playback shouldn't all be scheduled at once
Initial song parameters for Channel 1,... Channel N
Song Loop From

MIDI/Input
----------
New modes: combinations with phrase trigger+transpose in lower 2 octaves
Add a metronome function

Synth
-----
UI Rewrite
Choice of New Note Action (release, cut)
Choice of sample release action? (fade or not)
Sample resampling, crossfade
Add sample slicing
Time stretching
Probability
Instruments
Velocity & Pitch Automations
Changes for 1 line vs changes over a pattern vs ongoing results?
Allow choosing sampled notes by time as well as by pitch (for percussion)?

Glide / Arpeggio
-----
Glide amount (a time or a rate)
Glide mode (time or rate)
Handle gate triggered previously but not yet closed

Noise
-----
Noise through S&H as a modulation source


------
LFO modulating decay, etc.
LFO rate modulated by an envelope
LFO rate modulated by an LFO
LFO amount modulated by an LFO
Pulse width modulated by an envelope
