Sequencer
---------
* copyParameter and swapParameters should work between two columns (or the same column) of a pattern rather than (limited to) within a phrase (+turn into generators)
option to alter LINE_TIME changes inside expand(), compact() and copyAndCompact
Method to quantize to every x lines (also reduce delays for x<1, set to 0 otherwise) How to handle pattern/phrase delay?
	Complementary method to randomize
* Phrase.transpose needs to transpose phrases not currently transposed

* Let PHRASE_TRANSPOSE work when rows are not aligned
* Change PATTERN_DELAY to PHRASE_DELAY
* Allow each column to loop independently (remove pattern length property)
	* Allow columns to move at different tempos
	* Master column to move at the speed of the slowest column
Second kind of loop: column loop
	* Columns that exhaust their rows before another column completes start looping
	- Can designate one column to loop x times before moving onto the next pattern (otherwise the pattern ends when the longest column completes once (including normal loop parameters))
	- If the same phrase is on the same channel in two consecutive patterns then have the option to continue playing without restarting ("free running", offset ignored) as a phrase property
Phrase:
	* loop on/off (when not used as a column)
	* loop start point
	- "free running" on/off

Add PHRASE_VELOCITY parameter
Handle when a pattern with nested phrases is expanded or compacted: Add a PHRASE_SPEED parameter?
Loop start and end position incrementing (how to counter messing up fades?)
Edit function to reverse a sequence of rows
Phrase/pattern forwards/backwards (step 1, -1, maybe more) (how to counter messing up fades?)
(Song playback shouldn't all be scheduled at once)
	Actually a whole pattern should be scheduled at once so ChangeType.EXPONENTIAL works
Initial song parameters for Channel 1,... Channel N

Easy
-----
Document find-replace

MIDI/Input
----------
New modes:
	unison
	combinations with phrase trigger+transpose in lower 2 octaves
Metronome UI

UI
--
Bug: when MAX_WAVEFORM is changed while noise is active (fix during the rewrite)
Add touch driven piano (if the app's going to be used on mobile)

Sampler
-------
crossFade() should use a sine curve
amplify() should support *exponential* fades
trim silence method
Time stretching
Add custom offset/beat slice positions, stop at next slice
MOD2Sample (advanced)

Synth
-----
Reverb
UI Rewrite
Choice of sample release action (fade or end loop)
Choice of New Note Action
	(release, cut, continue until gate closed or cut, duplicate notes of the same instrument always cut)
Probability
Instruments
Velocity & Pitch Automations
	Add "Noise Type 2" to UI
Changes for 1 line vs changes over a pattern vs ongoing results?
Allow choosing sampled notes by time as well as by pitch (for percussion)?

Glide / Arpeggio
-----
Glide amount (a time or a rate)
Glide mode (time or rate)
Handle gate triggered previously but not yet closed

Noise
-----
Noise through filter as a modulation source

Low Priority
------------
Parse smpl and inst chunks of a WAV file.
Parse more than one sample per IFF file + envelope chunks, etc.
Make modals local to the component (Sampler, Synth...) (https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-display-a-bootstrap-modal-inside-a-div/)
Insert silence modal: String should be fixed length, overtype entry, spinners increment current column

------
LFO modulating decay, etc.
LFO rate modulated by an envelope
LFO rate modulated by an LFO
LFO amount modulated by an LFO
**Pulse width modulated by an envelope**
