Sequencer
---------
Ability to transpose a column?
Allow each column to loop independently
Phrase loop on/off, loop start point
Hold and decay samples?
Add pattern starting offset to song data
Loop start and end position incrementing (how to counter messing up fades?)
Phrase/pattern forwards/backwards (step 1, -1,...) (other values may mess up fades)
Song playback shouldn't all be scheduled at once
Initial song parameters for Channel 1,... Channel N
Loop from

Synth
-----
UI Rewrite
UI Make frequency slider logarithmic
Choice of New Note Action (release, cut)
Sample finetune
Add sample slicing
Time stretching
Probability
Instruments
Velocity & Pitch Automations
Changes for 1 line vs changes over a pattern vs ongoing results?
Default keyboard octave for an instrument (automatic?)
Allow choosing sampled notes by time as well as by pitch

Glide / Arpeggio
-----
Glide amount (a time or a rate)
Glide mode (time or rate)
Handle gate triggered previously but not yet closed

Noise
-----
Noise through S&H as a modulation source


------
LFO rate modulated by an envelope
LFO rate modulated by an LFO
LFO amount modulated by an LFO
Pulse width modulated by an envelope
